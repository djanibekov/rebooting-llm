# torchaudio - Install specific version based on your PyTorch and CUDA version if needed
# Example: torch==2.1.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# For general use / CPU:
torchaudio

transformers>=4.30.0 # Or a version compatible with Llama2 and Hubert
gradio>=3.50.0 # Or a recent version of Gradio

# Other potential dependencies (add if your Qformer.py or other parts need them beyond transformers):
# sentencepiece # Often needed by tokenizers like Llama's
# protobuf # Sometimes a dependency of sentencepiece or other model components
# accelerate # For faster model loading and inference, if applicable

# Ensure fairseq is NOT listed if the goal is a standalone demo without fairseq dependencies.
# If any part of the copied code *still* implicitly requires fairseq components
# that were not self-contained, they would need to be added or stubbed out.
